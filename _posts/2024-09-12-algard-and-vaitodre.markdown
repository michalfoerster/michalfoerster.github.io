## Chapter One
Rappia was the name of the stead where these things came to pass. It stood by a brook of like name, in the northern reaches of the Turola Mountains, beyond the Nirtelebugga Pass.

The stead was held by a veding of the Nervin family. On site in his name ruled a man called a labban, who also saw to the timbermen. Gunt was his name. He had several guards under him to watch over the workers and the goods.

The wood was brought through the forest to the downstream Glothun Station, where raftsmen floated it down the Nirtele stream and beyond. Since they primarily harvested silmenis trees, armed guards protected the workers. They also safeguarded the transport to the station.

There was a man named Älgard, who held great sway among the labban’s guards. He was distantly related to the veding, but through his conduct he had fallen from favour. He was sent into the mountains, so that he would cause no more trouble. Yet he was a good fighter and knew many things, and for that his skills were prized—especially when it came to tracking the wild folk.

It was he who first found the path that led to the Rhukastar Cave. This came about when he was ranging near the stead, seeking out raiders. These men would at times waylay the raftsmen, and they had been seen near Glothun and lower still. Of late, they had turned their eyes toward Rappia. 

When Älgard came to the mouth of the cave, he felt a draught blow out from its depths. He took this as an ill omen. Moreover, the cave seemed deep, unusual for this part of the mountains. He did not go in. Instead, he marked the path behind him, so none would follow his trail, and then returned to the stead.

He went at once to the labban and spoke to him thus:

'I’ve found a cave in the mountains, not far from the felling grounds.  I tell you this so you may know: the guard must be gathered, and the place searched or sealed. Else something may come out of it.'

'And what might come out of it?', said Gunt, mocking him. 'A bear? Or maybe wildlings cowering inside, afraid to stick out their noses?'

'Let it be nothing worse', Älgard replied with anger, for he saw they took him for a coward.

He said no more.

Winter was drawing near. The labban was eager to fulfill the tally of timber and satisfy the veding. He ordered Älgard to oversee preparations for a new shipment. In truth, he wished to be rid of him for a time, that he might not meddle in his plans.

The guards loathed escorting the timbermen. The path through the woods was steep, and rains turned it to mud, hard to pass. Moreover, bandits haunted the route. The warriors could either hasten the journey by assisting with transport  or they could spare themselves the labour but spend longer on the track. Neither choice was much liked. Those who remained in Rappia were deemed lucky.

Älgard decided to handpick his crew. He aimed to return early and, without the labban’s knowledge, , gather a band to search the cave.

He went first to a man named Drastun. He was a large fellow, honest highlander and unafraid of risk. His hall stood on the edge of the stead, where he lived with his kin. He held a bit of land, though it brought him little joy, and he was not well off. He would be glad to better his lot.


'Listen, Drastun', Älgard began. 'I’ll need your help. If you agree, there may be gains in it for you.'

'Speak your troubles', Drastun replied. 'Perhaps we can solve them together.'

Then Älgard told him of a cave not far off, which might be held by raiders and hide their hoard. So he shaped the tale to show Drastun there was silver in the venture, and said no word of the fears he bore.

'We must act quickly', said Älgard at last. 'Otherwise, snow will block the paths until spring. By then, rumors could spread. I’d hate for someone to beat us there.'

'I feel this much', Drastun said, 'you would not speak to me of this if it were so easy to enter the cave. But you have not found a coward.'

Together, they recruited two others: brothers Dirsun and Gavb, though details were withheld.

Yet Älgard’s wife came to know of his plans, for he let it slip in his speech. Likpeusa was her name. They had no children, and she held that this was not by her fault. For that cause she meant to leave him, and only waited for the spring to return to her kin.

Seizing an opportunity, Likpeusa sent word to the labban. They met at the sacrificial stone. Unaware, Älgard departed with the timbermen. The journey took five days. Though they hurried, one man was wounded, delaying their return.

Gunt, eager for plunder, sought to overtake Älgard. He took three men and wandered the mountains for three days until finding the rocky path. When they came before the cave, Gunt spoke to his men:

'If a bear lies there, we’ll drive it out with fire. Stand brave and fear nothing.'

They lit a fire at the entrance and threw torches inside. But lo, a roar rose from within Rhukastar, so great and fierce that it quenched the fire and the brands alike. The men fled into the woods, and some, struck by dread, were as if witless. 

Gunt hid in a crevice until the roar ceased, then fled back to the stead, leaving his men and gear behind. He told no soul what had passed. He would not suffer even Likpeusa to come near him.

The next night, fire blazed in the mountains. Many in lower steads saw it. Girmigars crawled from Rhukastar, setting trees ablaze. Drawn by scent, it stormed the stead and began the slaying. Seven lives were taken before dawn broke and the beast withdrew into the wild.

Survivors prepared to flee, but no guard would lead them. Älgard had not returned; the rest were injured or too afraid to leave their homes. The only exit led through the logged forest, , and men feared that Girmigars lay in wait there.

Gunt was among those too craven to leave their halls. He would not speak to the folk, nor make sacrifice. When warriors dragged him to the courtyard, one said:

'If you will not speak, then step down from your place. Let another take the lead and say what must be done.'

The speaker was Divil, whom Gunt suspected of coveting his position. Gunt answered him thus:

'Hold your tongue, Divil! I know your mind. You’ve a serpent’s heart, quick to betray. The veding’s guards expelled you for abandoning a comrade!'

Then Divil made to strike the labban, but others held him back, and that was the end of it. Gunt said no more. Seeing that nothing could be done with him, the folk began to hold counsel without him.

Some said they must lead the people out of the stead. Others called for raising ramparts and hurling stones and fire at the beast when next it came, until it fell dead. Yet few put faith in that. They had seen the corpses and knew well that such a foe would not be felled by arms alone.

Most of the day passed. Some timbermen fled, but many feared to leave the stead. By dusk the labban had yet made no ruling, and when night came, each man barred his hall. Some crept down into root cellars, thinking these might spare them when the beast returned.


## Chapter Two
There were wild folk dwelling not far off, the vilas, who kept to a hidden valley beyond the high ridge. Chief among them was a woman called Vudran. She was wife to a wild hunter named Sasnir, a man of keen sight and swift foot.

It was Sasnir who first beheld the beast Girmigars, sliding like fire-shadow through the forest. No sooner had he seen it than he turned back through the woods, swift as the wind over stone, to bring word to his kin.

*Girmigars has left his lair,*<br>
*Hungry for blood among men.*<br>
*The warriors want to resist,*<br>
*Yet their path leads to Bedubnis.*<br>

So spoke Sasnir. The wild folk heeded him and gathered what they could carry. Then, they fled their valley, toward the heatherlands of Silirte. But when the time came for Vudran to follow, she stood her ground and would not flee. And thus she spoke:

'I have seen glevaners in the woods.'

So she and her kin named the folk from the north.

'Aye', Sasnir agreed. 'But they’ve chosen their fate. There is nothing we can do to change it. And among us, there are no kalvedars.”'

Having said this, he turned toward the moorlands.

There was a valley between the mountains where the pond of Galaurs spread out. Vudran went there without telling her husband. On the shores of the pond she prayed in the wild tongue. From the depths of the lake rose a stolim. Thus he spoke:

'Why didn’t you flee?' he asked. 'Girmigars will bring death to all. It is goldlust that has led them to ruin.'

'Father of Galaurs, can you not defeat him?'  the girl replied.

'I came when these mountains were young', said the stolim. 'I’ll remain until they crumble. Such is my fate - no other.'

Yet Vudran was not frightened by the giant’s words.

'Father,' she spoke again, 'since our ancestors came to these lands, you and your kin have been our allies.'

'The choice is yours, child. If you truly desire it, here is my aid.'

The stolim reached into the pond’s depths and drew a latris blade, glowing like the sun. The giant placed the latris upon a boulder before the girl, and the stone split in two from the heat. This is why people now call that place Drastabs Dalmun.

Vudran accepted the stolim’s gift and wept.

## Chapter Three
Without waiting for the blade to burn, Vudran set out for Rappia. Älgard also arrived with his men. He appeared by evening, so there was no longer time to plan an escape.

He ordered the people to hide in earth cellars and food stores, while he himself, along with the guards who still obeyed him, took up position in a house at the front of the village, near those previously attacked by the monster. He blocked the windows and barricaded the door, but left a few openings through which the enemy could be struck with spears. He also dug a narrow passage beneath the house.

When night fell, Älgard and his companions hid inside the house. At moonrise, Girmigars attacked. He howled wildly and shrieked so horribly that the weak-hearted died on the spot. Älgard commanded his men to plug their ears and sing loudly. Yet, out of fear, they dropped their swords and stood frozen like stone.

At last, when Girmigars leapt onto the roof of the house where the guards were hiding, they raised their spears. Some blows struck him, only enraging him further. He began tearing the thatch from the roof, trying to reach those hidden inside. Seeing what was happening, Älgard opened the tunnel beneath the house. Girmigars tried to squeeze through, but it was too narrow for him.

Meanwhile, Älgard’s men escaped through the door on the other side of the cottage. He himself stayed behind with Drastun, goading the enemy to further enrage him. When the creature was nearly inside, Älgard set fire to the wood piled within. Those who had made it out sealed the passage from their side. Then Älgard and Drastun rushed toward the exit, hoping to save themselves. But Girmigars seized the second man and tore his arm off. Älgard fled.

The cottage burned. People gathered around, hoping Girmigars would burn to death. Instead, he burst through the roof. Though flames devoured his skin, the monster hurled himself at the crowd, killing many. Älgard struck him with a sword, but no weapon could seriously wound Girmigars. Soon, the man fell, wounded in the side.

The furious creature slaughtered the people, and no one could stop him. Many, frozen in fear, could not even move. As if under a spell, they waited for death. Then Vudran arrived, holding high the blade of latris above her head.

To the people, it seemed the girl carried a star in her hands, so powerful was the stone’s radiance. The stead was bathed in light, as if it were midday, and all shadows fled before the gem’s power.

Seeing the weapon that could wound him, Girmigars spoke:

*Daughter of Hilim brings death,*<br>
*With stone born of stolim’s blood.*<br>
*But she herself shall perish*<br>
*If she seeks to save the men.*<br>

Girmigars reached for Vudran with his claw, aiming for her eye. But he missed, slashing her cheek instead. Vudran fell. When the creature stood over her to deliver the final blow, she drove the blade beneath his arm. It pierced his heart. Thus he died.

The latris burned away completely, and some later said the beast had been slain by sorcery. Others claimed Älgard or one of the remaining guards had done it. Because of this confusion, it became easier for Gunt to later defend his position before the veding.

Then came Sasnir. He took Vudran into his arms and knelt beside the monster’s carcass. The girl died soon after.

## Chapter Four
Sasnir wept bitterly. Still kneeling with Vudran in his arms, he sang a song in the language of the wilds in her honor. The people who were present rushed at him, fearing sorcery. They gagged him, then bound him and hanged him on a nearby beech tree. That night, a bear came, bit him, and ate him.

Älgard piled up a mound for Vudran behind the stead. This place is still called Ruganvirs or Vudrangarbs.

After all this, the people left Rappiia, heading to lower stations and steads. No one dared check what lay inside the cave, fearful of encountering something worse. Älgard accused Gunt:

'Don’t think you won’t face punishment,' he told him. 'Veding will learn of your deeds.'

Älgard planned to go to the veding in the spring and present all of labban‘s actions, especially the death of Drastun. Gunt was afraid of these words, though he didn’t show it.

'I know exactly how things stand,' he replied to Älgard. 'And what they think of you there. You won’t accomplish anything at court, and you’ll only bring trouble upon yourself.'

'We’ll see,' Älgard said. 'But you can be sure that I won’t let this matter rest.'

Divil had been a witness to the conversation. He suggested to Älgard that they deal with Gunt right there. But Älgard refused. His wound still troubled him, and besides, he wanted to settle things according to the law.


“The veding is behind the mountains,” Divil stated. “He won’t help you when it comes down to it.”

The guards stayed in the stead to help with the last transport before winter. None of the timbermen wanted to continue working in Rappia, while the slaves were too few and not familiar with the work.  It was decided to pass the matter on to the veding.

Älgard returned home, where Likpeusa awaited him. Though their relationship was strained, he told her he intended to leave the settlement before the harshest of the winter came. If the pass turned out to be impassable, Älgard planned to go around the mountains, though it would add quite a bit of distance. He also feared that labban might persuade the others against him.

Likpeusa said she would gladly accompany her husband:

'Nothing holds me here. But take some proof of Girmigars’ death with you, and perhaps the veding will reward you for this deed.”

'I don’t want to lie about it,' Älgard replied. 'I’ve had enough of the evil that’s already been done. That woman died for us without a word. And we killed her companion.'

Likpeusa responded:

'You shouldn’t worry about it. The wilds don’t live like humans, and we’ll never have anything in common with them. Didn’t the king drive them out of Lingvar?'

Älgard went to bed with a heavy heart. That night, Likpeusa prepared a potion, which she gave to her husband the following day. He drank it, thinking it was medicine for the wound the monster had given him. Some time later, he died, which greatly pleased labban.

Likpeusa then went to Gunt, hoping to persuade him to go on an expedition to Rhukastar. He, however, refused to hear of it and sent her away empty-handed. He also began to suspect who she really was.

Meanwhile, he prepared a pit with salt, into which he threw Girmigars’ head. In the spring, when the path through the mountains was passable, Gunt took the head and brought it to the veding. The veding was astonished by the story, but didn’t want to believe that the beast had been slain under labban’s command. He rewarded labban and kept him close. Some time later Divil reported the truth of what had happened and what Älgard had done. Hearing this, the veding called labban to explain himself.

'Lord, you have his word against mine,' Gunt replied. 'Shouldn’t I have slain Älgard if what Divil says is true? Yet I did nothing to him, and if he hadn’t fallen ill, he’d be standing here before you. Wasn’t it I who brought you Girmigars’ head?'

Thus, he brushed off all accusations. Later, when a year had passed, he asked the veding for a release from court, to which the veding agreed. He settled in the foothills, on land beyond the Dusin Forest, where he lived to a ripe old age. From his line came Survaban.

What happened to Likpeusa remains unknown. I’ve heard she died in Rhukastar. She was supposed to go there with Dirsun and Gavb, whom she had persuaded to plunder the cave. Another tale speaks of Dirsun’s deeds. It is also said that Likpeusa, like every witch, eventually turned into a serpent, but I cannot believe this.

And thus ends the story.

## Notes
The story of Älgard and Vaitōdre ('Älgard ir Vudran gerbutun') was included in the so-called Codex Nervin, which contains the history of the Nervin family - from its mythical beginnings to its destruction during the Ruin of Lingvar. It complements the tale of Älgard, disinherited from the Nervin family by a veding named Nöting.

This story is significant for several reasons. First and foremost, it presents the pre-history of Rhukastar, the cave from which the dragon Lingvarangs originated, which caused the ruin of the entire kingdom. It also confirms the view that the monster was awakened due to the machinations of witches.

The story is also a testament to the time when the vilas (referred to here as 'the wilds') were outcasts, outside the law. This situation only changed under king Survaban, who, as the story suggests, ironically came from the line of labban Gunt. This plot thread is likely an interpolation by a later editor. It’s hard to imagine that when the story of Älgard was originally written, it would have contained such favorable views on the vilas.

The reader should also be aware of the fictional elements embedded in the story. These include Girmigars’ ability to speak and, more notably, his use of poetry. Less obvious is the incorporation of Lingvarian beliefs into Sasnir’s speech, particularly when he refers to the land of the dead Bedubnis, as well as the changing of the vilas’s names to Norician ones.
