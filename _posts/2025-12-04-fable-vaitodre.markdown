## Part One

In the mountains we call Turola, known to the vilas as Velsire, there lay a hidden valley named Rōdmine. Since time immemorial the descendants of Hilim had lived there — the vilas of the clan of Melar.

When humans first appeared in the Turola mountains, the vilas were forced to hide in the forests. Yet the valley of Rōdmine remained undiscovered for a long time, and those who dwelt there enjoyed peace and freedom.

In those days, when this story takes place, there lived in the valley a girl named Vaitōdre, which means Speaking Water. She lived in a small house by the brook. Every morning, Vaitōdre would stand on the stony bank and feed her favourite eel who lived in the stream. If you wish to know, his name was Jollytail.

There was someone else in Rōdmine who was dear to the girl’s heart. His name was Sislauden, and he was a hunter — though people valued him most for his beautiful voice. In the evenings he sang the songs of the vilas: of Princess Sōline, of the First Land, and of the Tree Veitarne; of the isle of Adalsia and the coming of Hilim.
Sometimes he would sit on the far side of the stream, singing only for Vaitōdre:

*O, gaile tiniel*<br>
*Asgrinde evs siran!*<br>
*Darine lainel*<br>
*Varo tevs enoian?*<br>

At other times they walked through the mountains together, marveling at the wonders hidden there. And when Sislauden set out to hunt, Vaitōdre wandered through the wild on her own, helping its dwellers — carrying messages between the lake-maidens of the mountain tarns, rescuing young chamois lost among the crags, or waking a sleepy bear from slumber.

One day, returning from the mountains, Vaitōdre noticed fire glowing upon the rocks. Being a wise girl, she understood at once what it might mean. A dragon had awakened in Turola — and this was the worst news of all. The girl was ready to run down toward the valley and warn her people, yet it occurred to her that she should first see whether the creature had hurt anyone.

When a vila wishes, she can move so silently that none of us would notice her even if she passed right beside us. Vaitōdre slipped like a shadow through the forest and reached the path climbing toward the heights. The path ended near a rock where the dragon’s cave was found.

A bright red glow shone from within the cave. Vaitōdre did not dare come closer; she would not risk drawing the beast’s attention. In the firelight illuminating the slopes, she saw human tracks.

“What clumsy creatures,” she murmured to herself. “Their traces are everywhere.”

She grimaced, for the wind carried the scent of burning.

Everything pointed to the same conclusion: humans had awakened the dragon. Their footprints led straight into the cave. Only humans could be so reckless as to enter the lair of a sleeping monster. No vila, no beast, no mountain dweller would ever do such a thing. Vaitōdre had to warn the people of Rōdmine at once. There was no time to lose.

She darted down the path leading toward the forest stream. Beyond the stream stretched the woods, and beyond them — ridges and the hidden valley.

Because of tree felling, the forest in this part of the mountains was thinned. Stumps stood everywhere, the ground was torn, and the undergrowth trampled. Saddest of all was that even the most beautiful trees — the silvery silmenises, so beloved by the vilas — had fallen to the woodcutters’ axes.

“And what do we have here?” murmured Vaitōdre.

The path, which had so far run downhill, now split in two. Through a small grove she glimpsed rooftops. She hesitated. Clearly this was a human settlement — most likely the woodcutters and their families. And surely they were the ones who had awakened the dragon. They were asleep now, unaware of the danger creeping upon them.

“I should warn them,” the girl said. “But I do not know their language. How am I to tell them that a monster may appear at any moment?”

She thought it might be enough simply to wake them. If she could rouse the villagers, perhaps they would notice the flames and flee. So Vaitōdre crept toward the settlement and picked up two torches lying beside the snoring guards. She lit them, and shouting at the top of her lungs, began waving the flaming brands.

“Wake up! Wake up! A dragon! A dragon!”

As you may guess, the guards were the first to stir. They rubbed their eyes and seized their spears. In those days humans feared the vilas. They called them rugans or wildlings, and believed them to be dangerous beings. It was no wonder, then, that the guards took the girl for an enemy — perhaps even a herald of some greater calamity. Without thinking, they rushed at her, calling for help.

“Stop!” cried Vaitōdre. “I will not harm you!”

But it was the humans who wished to harm her. The girl had to defend her life. With a torch she struck aside a spear-thrust, then fled into the dark forest. In the thicket the guards had no chance of finding her. They might as well have searched for a shadow or a spirit. Out of their sight, Vaitōdre climbed a tree to see what would happen next.

“I hope this commotion was enough to wake them,” she thought.

It seemed that it had. More and more people poured from their huts — some with weapons, others half-asleep and confused. The guards gestured wildly toward the forest where the girl had vanished. Then all lifted their heads, seeing the strange sight upon the mountains: fire blazing on the rocks.

Vaitōdre decided this was enough. She leapt down from the tree and sped toward her home to warn Sislauden.

## Part Two

When the girl arrived, she discovered that her friend was gone. Before Sislauden’s house lay four river stones stacked one atop another. This meant the hunter had set out to hunt and would not return for at least four days.

Vaitōdre was troubled. She would not reach Sislauden in time to warn him about the dragon. Her first thought was to find him immediately. Yet such a task was nearly impossible.

Sislauden was a skilled hunter. When he prowled the mountain forests, he hid so well that even his kin could not find him. Vaitōdre might as well have sought the wind in a field.

Seeing there was nothing she could do, she left a message about the dragon at his doorstep and went to sleep. At dawn she meant to set out again.

That night she dreamed terrible dreams. She woke before sunrise, frightened that something had gone wrong. As dawn spread over the peaks, the girl left her home. But she did not flee from the dragon. Instead, she walked back toward the human village.

“Watch the house,” she said to Jollytail as she left. “Until I return, you are the master here.”

Even before she reached the settlement of the woodcutters, she knew the night had not been peaceful. Smoke lingered above the village. Just as the day before, Vaitōdre climbed a tree at the forest’s edge to better see what had happened.

Several huts on the outskirts had been burned. People moved about, extinguishing smouldering beams. Their faces were grim. Vaitōdre understood that the dragon had attacked the woodcutters in the night.

A little farther on, before the chief’s house, several guards stood speaking with a stout man who seemed to be someone of importance. A steward, perhaps.

“We will not survive another night,” said one of the guards. “We tried fighting the beast, but our spears cannot pierce its scales. We must flee.”

“Flee?” snorted the stout man. “And what if the dragon lurks in the forest? He’ll pick us off like an eel catching crayfish in the mud.”

Only one road led down the slope from the village. If the woodcutters tried to escape, they would be helpless before the dragon. In the settlement they could at least attempt to hide in their huts — though, as the burned houses showed, such shelter was but an illusion.

“Let us build a palisade,” suggested another guard. “Let us pile earth around the houses. Fire cannot burn earth.”

“And after that? Shall we just wait? Hopeless!”

Vaitōdre listened no more. The situation was clear: trapped in the village, the humans had two choices — flee or wait for the dragon’s attack. Either way meant ruin. They needed help.

As is well known, no sword or spear can kill a dragon. Not even the strongest warrior can pierce the creature’s thick scales. Fire does not harm it, nor any poison. The only thing that can wound a dragon is a blade forged from enchanted amber. Humans call it latyr, and the vilas call it kalatar, for its glow.

In ancient times, the vilas drew latyr from the sea. Beneath the water it took on a greyish-silver hue, but once lifted above the surface it began to burn — a hidden flame consuming it from within until the amber vanished entirely.

Yet while it burned, no matter existed that it could not cut or pierce.

Vaitōdre knew all this. And she knew she had no time to reach the sea and return with a weapon to save the humans. The journey would take days, and in that time the dragon would surely destroy the village. But there was another way.

A day’s journey beyond Rōdmine, high in the mountains, lay a lake where a stolim dwelled. Stolims were kindly giants who watched over mountains, forests, or lakes. They hated dragons and fought against them. Vaitōdre decided to seek the stolim’s aid.

Once more she moved through the mountain forests like a shadow. Driven by need, she was swifter than many a trained runner. Before the day ended, she stood breathless before the calm waters of the lake. She bowed respectfully and spoke the spell:

“Va! Keltin tilmene, nōrkenir! Eido tan keresume egele.”

At her words the waters boiled, and from the churning waves emerged the face of an old man with a blue beard. His eyes were wise and calm as the rocks surrounding the lake. He studied the girl closely, then asked:

“What brings the daughter of Hilim to my waters? Why do you wake me from my slumber?”

Vaitōdre bowed again, hands clasped.

“Father of the lake,” she said. “I have come to ask for your help. As in the ancient days when you and your brothers fought the serpents who wished to destroy the world, so now we need your aid again.”

She told him of the village and the dragon the woodcutters had awakened. The stolim listened carefully, while small fish leapt from his beard and plopped back into the water.

“What of your warriors?” he finally asked. “Is there none who can face the creature?”

“Alas,” said Vaitōdre. “Only one hunter remains in the valley besides me. No one else can help the humans.”

She sighed, longing for Sislauden’s presence. His help would have been invaluable.

“I cannot help you,” said the giant, sorrow in his voice. “Our time has long passed. Soon we will vanish entirely, becoming that which we once guarded — lakes, rivers, forests, and stone. I cannot leave this place. Until a new flame rekindles the earth, I must wait and dream.”

Hearing this, Vaitōdre wept for the fate of the humans. Was there no hope for them?

“Do not fear, child,” said the stolim gently. “There is always hope, even in the darkest hour. Take this blade. It is called Tareva, the Reed-Blade, and once belonged to Kalvedil himself.”

As he spoke, the giant drew from the lake a spear tipped with a blade of grey amber. It was latyr, preserved from burning by the water. Vaitōdre accepted the gift and wrapped the blade in wet cloth. She thanked the stolim and began the journey home.

On the way she pondered what she must do. She was no warrior, and she knew nothing of fighting dragons. Yet she could not abandon the humans to the monster. Without a magical blade they stood no chance.

Such troubling thoughts followed her as she walked by moonlight toward the village. But it was not only the moon that lit her path. A red glow rose from the settlement — the light of burning huts. The dragon had not forgotten its dinner.

Vaitōdre quickened her steps. She gripped the Reed-Blade and tore off its covering. Emerging from the forest, she saw a terrifying sight. A great serpent-bodied monster loomed in the center of the village. It was surrounded by burning roofs and a handful of guards who tried in vain to harm it with spears and axes. Their weapons were useless against its scales — this Vaitōdre knew well.

The dragon’s shadow slithered across the walls of the huts, striking fear into every heart. Each lash of its tail cracked like thunder.

Despite her terror, the girl rushed forward. The grey amber flickered, then burst into inner flame. Warmth pulsed from the blade, lighting the night and giving courage.

“Begone, creature!” she cried, leaping from the forest.

Though she did not know how to wield the spear, her hands guided the blade toward the beast. The dragon, startled by the sudden attack, had barely turned its head when the Reed-Blade struck its side.

The monster roared, and the guards fell to the ground in fear. The burning blade in Vaitōdre’s hand drove deep into the dragon’s flank, inflicting a grievous wound. It spewed fire, setting another hut ablaze, then swung its tail. Vaitōdre had no time to dodge. The blow knocked her from her feet and hurled her toward the forest. The breath left her lungs. The spear slipped from her grasp and rolled aside.

Enraged by pain, the dragon lunged at the remaining humans, reaching for them with its claws. Vaitōdre tried to rise, but her body would not obey. Her left leg was numb and burning with agony — she must have broken it when she fell. She could not reach the weapon; even if she could, she was in no state to fight.

Certain that she and the humans would perish, she suddenly saw a shadow spring from the forest. A figure dressed as a hunter raced past her, snatching up the Reed-Blade. The dragon was preoccupied with two guards it held in its claws, perhaps deciding which one to devour first.

The figure ran up the beast’s tail, and before the dragon could react, sprinted along its back and drove the burning blade straight into its skull.

If the first roar had terrified the villagers, the last was a hundred times worse. Vaitōdre later remembered that every leaf fell from the surrounding trees. But no one else was harmed. The dragon, spewing one final burst of flame toward the moon, collapsed and breathed its last.

Silence fell over the village. Only the crackling of burning wood remained.

Vaitōdre exhaled with relief, thankful the humans were saved. She turned to see her rescuer, but at that moment her body failed her and she fainted. She remained unconscious through the rest of the night.

She awoke to the murmur of the brook she knew so well, and the wind that drifted through her kitchen window and slipped beneath the roof of her house. She lifted her head from the pillow, glancing around. It was midday. Her injured leg had been expertly bound and bandaged. She saw leaves tucked beneath the bandages — they would hasten healing.

Someone entered through the open door. At first she could not recognize the figure through her weariness. But when she narrowed her eyes, she knew him.

“Sislauden,” she whispered with joy. “What are you doing here?”

The hunter sat beside her, smiling.

“I fed your eel,” he said. “He was hungry, and complained you were neglecting him.”

“I must apologise to him. As soon as I can stand.”

“Soon,” he assured her. “It was only a slight fracture. You were very brave.”

Vaitōdre frowned.

“What of them?” she asked. “Is the village safe?”

“Safe,” he replied. “Their chief has already claimed the glory of slaying the dragon.” Sislauden shook his head. “Humans never change, it seems. I wanted to return the Reed-Blade to the stolim, but it burned away entirely during the fight. Only the shaft remains. I think I shall use it as a bean pole. You like beans, don’t you?”

Vaitōdre smiled.

“Not really,” she said. “But we can feed them to Jollytail. We shall see if he likes them.”
