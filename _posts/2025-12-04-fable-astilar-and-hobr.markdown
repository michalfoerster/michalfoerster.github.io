*From the Legends of the Old Court. A tale written down by Kersiran*

Long, long ago, the kingdom of Andomir was ruled by an old and wise king named Inzuves. He had many friends who aided him in times of trouble, and the most renowned among them was Prince Astilar, who is the hero of this tale.

Astilar was a kind and helpful young man, always ready to aid the weak and those in need. Though he possessed a palace in the kingdom’s capital, the Old Court, he was found more often in the city squares and markets, spending his days among the townsfolk. Whenever someone faced hardship or misfortune, they could rely on Prince Astilar.

It happened one day that wild Narevings arrived from across the sea, drawn by the fame of King Inzuves and tempted by the riches of Andomir. The king’s knights confronted them at the mouth of the river Bregona, but the battle was lost. For the Narevings were accompanied by a mighty giant named Hobr, whom no warrior could defeat. Whenever a knight approached him, Hobr would huff and puff—and with a single breath the bold fighter would be blown a thousand paces away, swept off his feet by the giant’s enormous gust.

It seemed certain that the kingdom would fall. The Nareving army marched toward the Old Court, and no one could stand in their way. Troubled, the king summoned Prince Astilar. When the young man came to the palace, Inzuves told him all that had befallen Andomir and begged for his help.

“My lord,” cried Astilar, “you ask too much of me! I am no stronger than your warriors, no wiser than your counsellors. How am I to defeat an entire army of enemies?”

“But it was my counsellors who urged me to summon you,” replied Inzuves with a smile. “And I, too, believe there is no better answer. I am certain you will succeed.”

And with that, he kindly patted the prince on the shoulder and led him to the palace gate.

Saddened, Astilar sat down upon the stone threshold. How was he to fulfil the king’s request? He saw no path before him. Yet though his heart was heavy, he was not one to surrender to despair. He rose, brushed the dust from his cloak, and told himself that a long walk was better than sitting idle and feeding his worries.

He wandered through the winding streets of the city until he reached the marketplace, where farmers sold their crops. The sight brightened his face, for he knew many of the sellers by name. They greeted him warmly, asking whether he desired anything from their modest harvests.

“I shall buy something indeed, since you ask so kindly,” he said. “A sack of beets.”

For as they spoke, a certain idea had come to Astilar’s mind.

After paying, the prince found his horse, mounted, and rode north—toward the camp of the Narevings. His journey was long, yet he did not lose heart. At last he reached a narrow ravine surrounded by ancient pines.

At the end of the ravine stood a ramshackle wooden hut, hastily assembled from whatever scraps were at hand. Grey smoke drifted from its chimney. Astilar dismounted, took the sack, approached the door, knocked—and then hid himself inside the beets.

After a long moment, the door creaked open. A huge face appeared, peering suspiciously across the clearing. At last its gaze fell on the sack at the threshold. Then the whole figure stepped outside. It was Hobr’s wife, a giantess. Without a second thought she lifted the sack and carried it indoors. She set it beside the hearth and returned to chopping onions.

For you must know that on that day Mistress Hobr was preparing soup for her husband, yet she lacked ingredients. Thus the beets found at her doorstep delighted her greatly.

While the giantess chopped onions, Prince Astilar, hidden among the beets, called out in a slightly altered voice:

“Ho, ho, ho!”

Mistress Hobr spun around at once, eyeing the room suspiciously. Seeing nothing, she decided it must have been the wind whistling through the chimney.

After a while, still busy with her cooking, the prince called out again:

“Ho, ho, ho!”

This time the giantess jumped as if pricked by a needle.

“Who’s there?” she cried sharply. “Show yourself at once!”

But Astilar remained silent among the beets. The giantess thought perhaps her old cat, Slipper, was mewling somewhere in the house, and returned to her work.

When the prince cried “Ho, ho, ho!” for the third time, the giantess ran to the middle of the room, wildly brandishing her onion-knife.

“What is going on?” she shouted, furious. “Who hides in my house? My husband will be home soon, and he’ll knock the foolishness out of you, trickster!”

Then Prince Astilar answered from within the beets:

“It is only us, the enchanted beets.”

“What? Who?” the giantess snapped, narrowing her eyes at the sack. “What beets?”

“Enchanted,” said the prince. “The great sorcerer of the Narevings cast a spell upon us. When your husband, giant Hobr, eats the soup made from us, he will become even stronger than ever before!”

Hearing this, Mistress Hobr put her hands on her hips and burst into hearty laughter.

“Enchanted beets, indeed! Oh, that is a fine joke!”

“You are unwise to doubt us,” said Astilar, pretending to be offended. “Through us your husband will become truly invincible.”

“But he already is invincible!” laughed the giantess. “He is the strongest giant in the world. No spell could make him stronger.”

“How can that be?” asked the prince.

“Because all my husband’s strength is hidden in his heart,” she replied. “And his heart is so well concealed that no one will ever find it.”

“You mean hidden in his chest?”

She shook her head.

“No—hidden in a secret place known to no man. Not even to the Narevings.”

“And where is this place?” asked Astilar.

The giantess hesitated. It was a secret she was forbidden to reveal. But the conversation with the “enchanted beets” amused her so much that she felt tempted to speak.

“Well, what does it matter,” she said at last. “You are only vegetables, soon to end up in the soup. I suppose I may tell you.”

She leaned closer.

“My husband’s heart is hidden inside an iron casket. That casket is hidden in the belly of a great fish. And the fish swims in an underground lake beneath a mighty mountain in the Devilwood. Yet even if someone found the mountain, it would do him no good. A great black dog guards it, and he devours anyone who approaches.”

“Surely he can be defeated?” asked the prince.

“I know nothing of that. No one has ever succeeded, though many have tried.”

“In that case,” said Astilar, “there truly is no way to defeat your husband.”

“That is true,” agreed the giantess. “And now I must return to my cooking.”

She picked up a beet and began peeling it. Prince Astilar waited till her back was turned, then sprang from the sack and hid behind the hearth.

Evening came, and with it the heavy steps of giant Hobr, audible from far away.

“Greetings, dear wife!” he boomed as he entered. “I am starving! But wait—hmm… do I smell a human?”

“No, my dear,” replied the mistress. “Only enchanted beets sent by the Nareving sorcerer.”

“Beets? Excellent! I do love beet soup. Let us dine.”

Hobr washed his hands and helped prepare the meal—glad to spend time with his wife rather than be out waging war.

After the giants had eaten, they lay down to sleep. Soon Hobr’s snoring shook the little hut, and with every snore the roof jumped three cubits into the air.

Seeing that the giants slept, Prince Astilar crept out from behind the hearth, slipped outside, found his horse, leapt into the saddle, and rode toward Devilwood through the night.

When he arrived, he cut himself a sturdy hazel staff, then approached the hill rising in the center of the forest. He had scarcely come near when a massive dog leapt from the thicket. This was the very hound Mistress Hobr had spoken of. If you wish to know, the dog’s name was Muskis.

The dog sprang at Astilar, jaws wide. The prince did not fear its sharp teeth. As the creature lunged, he thrust the hazel staff into its mouth. It stuck fast, so the dog could neither bite nor free itself.

Soon Muskis ran in circles around Astilar, whining and begging for help.

“I can free you,” said the prince, “but you must swear not to eat me. Do you promise?”

The dog nodded vigorously.

“And will you be my friend?” asked Astilar.

Again Muskis nodded. He had never had a friend before; both people and animals feared his fearsome size. So he gladly accepted the prince’s offer. Astilar gently pulled the staff from the dog’s jaws. Muskis licked his lips, pleased to feel his mouth free again, and then happily allowed himself to be scratched behind the ears. Thus the great black dog and Prince Astilar became friends.

The prince took Muskis with him. Together they went to the foot of the mountain, where they dug a deep hole. Muskis was of great help, for his mighty paws quickly carved a tunnel leading to the hidden lake. Prince Astilar cast his line, and before long he caught the great fish swimming in the darkness.

Astilar gutted the fish and roasted it over a fire. He ate half and shared the other with Muskis. From within the fish he drew an iron casket, and from the casket—the giant’s heart.

The moment Prince Astilar closed his hand around the heart, far away in his hut giant Hobr sprang up from his bed.

“My heart!” he cried in terror.

“It must be fine,” murmured his sleepy wife. “You only had a dream.”

But Hobr did not listen. He pulled on his boots and rushed out the door. Being a giant, he covered seven miles with every stride. Soon he reached Devilwood, where Astilar and the dog awaited him.

“Return my heart, thief!” roared the giant.

Prince Astilar did not tremble under the giant’s fierce gaze. Calmly he replied:

“No. Not until you cease tormenting my people and warring against my king.”

Hobr hesitated. He feared to battle the prince, who had outwitted him so effortlessly. Yet could he trust a man? The giant stood for a long while, eyeing first Astilar, then Muskis, who sat beside the prince, panting gently.

“At last,” Hobr muttered, shifting uneasily, “I promise.”

“You promise never again to fight my people? Never to attack or harm anyone?”

“Yes, yes—I promise.”

Prince Astilar smiled.

“Very well. Then I promise that your heart shall always remain safe. I will hide it in a chest in my palace treasury. No one will ever see it.”

Thus, on the edge of the forest, Prince Astilar and giant Hobr made a pact. They shook hands, and the giant also shook Muskis’s paw, taking him as witness.

Hobr never again attacked a human. In truth, he seldom left his hut, discovering in himself the soul of a home-lover. He often shared soup with his wife at supper. And Prince Astilar? He took the dog, returned home, and hid the giant’s heart safely in his treasury.

Deprived of their greatest advantage, the Narevings lost the battles that followed. At last, abandoning their hopes of conquering Andomir, they sailed back across the sea from whence they came.

Many years later, when giant Hobr grew old and died, he was buried with honor behind the Old Court, and over him was raised a great mound of earth. It stands there to this day and is called Hobairgs, the Hill of Hobr. Prince Astilar came to the funeral and, bidding farewell to his former foe, hid the iron casket containing the heart within the mound.

Thus ends this tale.
